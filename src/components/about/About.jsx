      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Since <span>2016</span>, my enthusiasm for <span>technology</span> has grown immensely. I was captivated by how <span>modern tech</span> could connect people and expand their reach worldwide. This realization ignited my passion for tech, which, in <span>2022</span>, inspired me to begin my journey in <span>web development</span>. From those initial steps, I dove deeper and evolved into a <span>full-stack software developer</span> and <span>business consultant</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my journey is fueled by a love for <span>building solutions</span> and making <span>tech accessible</span>. My background in <span>business</span> and <span>software</span> has allowed me to help companies <span>scale</span>, <span>innovate</span>, and connect with global audiences.
